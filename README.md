This isn't even my final form!  (Because it isn't all that safe; it still
depends on the same FS everything else is using.  A proper solution would come
with kexec stuff.)  But at least it should prevent me from doing anything too
stupid.

Just for test!!!

Note, this modified code only can pause process 15 (io.pangu.axe.untether.plist), but can not open 22 port!!! I don't know why can not execute sshd when boot.
